\section{Description and Proposal}

Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics\cite{DUMMY:1}
Deep learning is used in computer vision widely. Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images or video. Computer vision is the science and technology of machines that see and perceive.\cite{schalkoff1989digital}
\\Handwritten digit and character recognition is a  computer vision problem. This can be achieved by using deep learning techniques.\\There are several types of neural network available like Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Convolutional neural network (CNN)\cite{bouvrie2006notes}, Recurrent neural network (RNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Sequence-to-sequence models, Shallow neural networks etc. All these can be used to make a system that is capable of recognizing English Handwritten Digit.

Here, we are interested to find the optimized and effective neural network between
\begin{itemize}
  \item Multilayer perceptron
  \item Convolutional neural network(CNN)
\end{itemize}
